# MIP: Dual-Temporal Mamba Inertial Poser

Official repository for:
Mamba Inertial Poser: Dual-Temporal Causal Human Motion Tracking from Sparse Inertial Sensors

This repository provides the official implementation of MIP, a dual-temporal
state-space model for real-time full-body human motion capture from sparse IMU
sensors.

The codebase will be progressively released to support full reproducibility of
all experiments reported in the paper.

Setup
-----
cd kernels/selective_scan && pip install -e .


Planned Release
---------------

[ ] Dual-Temporal Mamba backbone and PQN modules  
[ ] Pretrained models and demo scripts  
[ ] Training and distillation code  
[ ] Evaluation and visualization tools
